**Author:** Kyle Andrade  
**Last Modified:** 2024/09/15

## Overview
The **AllergyPal** model classifies food images into 101 different categories using an EfficientNetB0 architecture. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on a dataset of food images and fine-tuned for increased accuracy.

## Features
- **Food Classification**: Classifies images into 101 food categories (e.g., apple pie, sushi, steak, etc.).
- **EfficientNetB0**: Pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model for feature extraction.
- **Training Data**: Trained on over 80,000 images with validation on 20,000 images.
- **Fine-tuning**: The model is fine-tuned for additional accuracy improvement.

## Final Product
The final product of **AllergyPal** was made by Jacob Foster & Kyle Andrade. It can be found [here.](https://github.com/fostej26/AllergyPal)
